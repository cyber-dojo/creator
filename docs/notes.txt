Refactor id58_test_base in creator so 5 slowest tests are printed one per line.
Only use \n terminated sections when defining the test so that appears when test fails.

Rework yml so
s/creator-client/client/
s/creator-server/creator/
This way nginx.conf (eg) has settings it will actually need in real nginx.
Will affect .sh files.

Drop attempt to distinguish between 400/500 error codes.
It's not useful.
Just return 500 and make sure 'exception' key is in the json response body
(and is also logged to stdout)

Add examples of 500 calls (and the exception) to sh/api_demo.sh

Can test (manually) in custom-chooser by [docker rm]ing
the saver service before clicking the [ok] button.
Can also test by [docker rm]ing the creator service.
This should give a different error (timeout?)

assert_ is getting quite repetitive...
How about just

json_post '/create_custom_group', args={
  display_name:any_custom_display_name
}
it_succeeded # it_failed
group_exists(id_from_json_response, args[:display_name])

Is that too terse?
Feels like I want a new trailing character like ! or ? both !?
