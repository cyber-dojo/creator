The main src code is in the /app dir.
This is added to the docker image using the Dockerfile command:
COPY --chown=nobody:nogroup . /app

There are some tests in /test_server
These are volume-mounted into, and run from inside a docker container
using the line in docker-compose.yml

  creator-server:
    volumes: [ "./test_server:/app/test:ro" ]

I would like to volume-mount like this:

  creator-server:
    volumes: [ "./test_server:/test:ro" ]

So the relative dir structure inside the container is the same as the
relative dir structure outside the container. This would mean a test file
could write

  require_relative '../app/services/http_json/error'

However, there is a problem with a dir structure like this:
/app
/test

The problem is that I want coverage of both the source and the tests
and SimpleCov is unable to work across two dirs like this.
If you try SimpleCov.root('/') it just does not work.
