post '/create.json'
------------------
This currently returns an id.
It should return a route.
Most of the time this will be '/kata/edit?id=ID'
And maybe a redirect too.

But what if saver is down?
For this I need to redirect to /kata/offline?ARGS
eg /kata/offline?language_name=XXXXXX&exercise_name=YYYYY
and the kata controller will have to rebuild the manifest
(from API on creator) and then delegate to
/kata/edit?ID=999999 with @manifest set.
