post '/create.json'
------------------
This returns a route.
Most of the time this will be '/kata/edit?id=ID'

But what if saver is down?
For this I need to redirect to /kata/offline?ARGS
eg /kata/offline?language_name=XXXXXX&exercise_name=YYYYY
and the kata controller (in web) will have to rebuild the manifest
(from API on creator) and then delegate to
/kata/edit?ID=999999 with @manifest set.
So creator needs to expose method to get manifest from language_name,exercise_name,display_name
This is only for individual katas, not for groups. Groups need persistence of saver.
